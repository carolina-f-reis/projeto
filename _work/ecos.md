intro: "In this project we were asked to select a physical product and to design an online store for it. We had to design the desktop version and use the elements and styles from a Design System created by us. This was an individual project and was made in about 2 months. <br>
I decided to create an online store for a fictional brand of footwear named Ecos. I started the process by an initial research and some benchmarking that served as inspiration to define a concept for my store. Ecos is a fictional online store for sustainable footwear. The brand values comfort through cool shoes that follow fashion trends, created with sustainably sourced raw materials."

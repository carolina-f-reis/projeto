intro: "This project was done by me and a friend for an online course and lasted 3 weeks. We were given a prompt, one simple question - How might we improve health in everyday places? From there we did some brainstorming and came up with the Greenshare app. <br>
The app provides search options of nearby community vegetable gardens and users can place their order online in a secure and easy way. They can also open up new possibilities for getting to know their community and invest in local businesses. <br>
Our design process followed 4 main phases: Discover, Define, Ideate and Design. In this project we had the opportunity to do some user research, a user flow, wireframes, a prototype and finally the visual component."

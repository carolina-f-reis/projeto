      <p>This project was done by me and a friend for an online course and lasted 3 weeks. We were given a prompt, one simple question - How might we improve health in everyday places?
      </p>
      <p> From there we did some brainstorming and came up with the Greenshare app. The app provides search options of nearby community vegetable gardens and users can place their order online in a secure and easy way. They can also open up new possibilities for getting to know their community and invest in local businesses.</p>
      <p> Our design process followed 4 main phases: Discover, Define, Ideate and Design. In this project we had the opportunity to do some user research, a user flow, wireframes, a prototype and finally the visual component.</p>

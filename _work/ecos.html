      <p>In this project we were asked to select a physical product and to design an online store for it. We had to design the desktop version and use the elements and styles from a Design System created by us. This was an individual project and was made in about 2 months.</p>
      <p>I decided to create an online store for a fictional brand of footwear named Ecos. I started the process by an initial research and some benchmarking that served as inspiration to define a concept for my store.</p>
      <p>Ecos is a fictional online store for sustainable footwear. The brand values comfort through cool shoes that follow fashion trends, created with sustainably sourced raw materials. </p>

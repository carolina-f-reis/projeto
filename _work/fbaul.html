      <p>The aim of this project was to develop a proposal to improve the website experience for the candidates at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon (FBAUL).</p>
      <p>Our design process started by defining the research goals: 1 - Understand the needs and expectations of the candidates; 2 - Identify strengths and pain points of the current website and the candidates' perceptions of it; 3 - Understand the application process and identify patterns, trends and best practices of several university websites.</p>
      <p>After the research phase we moved on to profiling our target users and to develop a new site map. Then we entered the ideation phase (wireframes, mockups, prototype) and finally we tested the new design with users and understood what mistakes we had to fix. </p>

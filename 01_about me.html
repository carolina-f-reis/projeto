<!--ABOUT-->
<section>
    <div class="about">
        <p>I’m passionate about usability and always strive to create interfaces that balance beauty and efficiency. <br>
        I studied Audiovisual and Multimedia at the School of Communication and Media Studies from the Lisbon Polytechnic, where I received my Bachelor’s degree in 2020. <br>
        Because of my interest in behavioral psychology, digital products and user experience, I decided to readjust my focus and I’m currently taking a Postgraduate course in Digital Experience Design. <br>
        Besides design I love to travel, to play guitar and to annoy my two cats from time to time.</p>
